# Credito Scoring Engine - System Design Document

## 1. System Overview

The Credito Scoring Engine is a backend service designed to manage and orchestrate external scoring services such as socioeconomic scoring and bank statement analysis. The system provides a unified interface for executing these services while ensuring reliability, scalability, and maintainability.

## 2. Architecture Design

### 2.1 High-Level Architecture

The system follows a layered architecture pattern with the following components:

```
[Client Request] 
       ↓
[API Controller]
       ↓
[Service Executor] → [Circuit Breaker + Retry Logic]
       ↓
[External Services]
```

### 2.2 Key Components

1. **API Layer** (`ScoringController`)
   - Handles HTTP requests
   - Validates incoming requests
   - Manages response status codes
   - Implements error handling

2. **Service Executor** (`ExternalServiceExecutor`)
   - Core business logic
   - Service configuration management
   - Retry mechanism
   - Circuit breaker implementation
   - Mock service handling for testing

3. **Configuration Management**
   - Service endpoints
   - Retry policies
   - Rate limiting rules

### 2.3 Data Flow

1. Client sends request to `/api/scoring/execute`
2. Request is validated and rate-limited
3. Service Executor processes the request:
   - Loads service configuration
   - Executes service with retry mechanism
   - Handles circuit breaker logic
4. Response is returned to client

## 3. Design Choices

### 3.1 API Design
- **RESTful API**: Simple HTTP POST endpoint for service execution
- **JSON Payload**: Flexible format for various service requirements
- **Swagger Documentation**: Auto-generated API documentation

### 3.2 Error Handling Strategy
1. **Multiple Layers of Error Handling**
   - Controller level for HTTP-specific errors
   - Service level for business logic errors
   - Global exception handling

2. **Retry Mechanism**
   - Configurable retry count
   - Configurable delay between retries
   - Progressive error handling

3. **Circuit Breaker**
   - Prevents cascade failures
   - Automatic service recovery
   - Configurable thresholds

### 3.3 Service Orchestration
- Configuration-based service management
- Dynamic service loading
- Mock service support for testing
- Comprehensive logging

## 4. Scalability & Extensibility

### 4.1 Horizontal Scalability
- Containerized deployment (Docker)
- Stateless design
- Rate limiting per instance

### 4.2 Adding New Services
1. Add service configuration to appsettings.json:
```json
{
  "Services": {
    "NewService": {
      "Name": "NewService",
      "Endpoint": "http://new-service/endpoint",
      "MaxRetries": 3,
      "RetryDelayMs": 1000
    }
  }
}
```
2. Service is automatically available through the API

### 4.3 Future Extensibility
- Easy integration of new services
- Configurable retry policies per service
- Expandable monitoring capabilities

## 5. Security & Protection

### 5.1 Rate Limiting
- Configurable limits per endpoint
- Protection against abuse
- Custom response headers

### 5.2 Error Handling
- Sanitized error messages
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Detailed internal logging

## 6. Monitoring & Logging

### 6.1 Logging Implementation
- Request/response logging
- Error logging with stack traces
- Service execution metrics
- Circuit breaker state changes

### 6.2 Metrics
- Execution time tracking
- Success/failure rates
- Retry attempts
- Circuit breaker status

## 7. Implementation Technologies

- **.NET 8.0**: Modern, high-performance framework
- **Docker**: Containerization
- **Polly**: Resilience and transient-fault handling
- **AspNetCoreRateLimit**: Rate limiting
- **Swagger**: API documentation

## 8. Deployment

The system is containerized using Docker, making it easy to deploy in various environments:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  api:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "5000:80"
    environment:
      - ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development
```

## 9. Future Improvements

1. **Enhanced Monitoring**
   - Integration with APM tools
   - More detailed metrics
   - Custom health checks

2. **Security Enhancements**
   - Authentication/Authorization
   - API key management
   - Request validation

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Caching layer
   - Response compression
   - Async I/O optimizations
