# Integration of Scoring Models

This document outlines the way to integrating scoring models, focusing on quality, testability, and seamless production deployment.

## 1. Test-Driven Development (TDD) Approach

### Write Tests First
Begin by writing tests that define the expected behavior of the scoring model integration. These tests specify how the system should react to various inputs and scenarios.

### Mocking Dependencies
Use dependency injection so that during testing, a mock or stub version of the scoring model can be substituted for the actual implementation. This allows us to isolate the component under test.

### Iterative Implementation
Start with tests that initially fail, then implement the minimal code required to pass these tests. This iterative approach ensures that every feature is driven by a corresponding test, which helps maintain code quality.

### Integration Testing
In addition to unit tests, perform integration tests to verify that the API layer correctly handles the input and output of scoring models, and that the system logs relevant execution details.

## 2. Using Stubs or Synthetic Test Models

### Stubs
During development, when the actual scoring models are not available, create simple stub implementations that simulate expected responses. For example, a stub could always return a fixed score value.

### Synthetic Data
Generate synthetic test data that mimics realistic input and output scenarios. This approach allows you to thoroughly test the system's behavior without relying on the availability of the real scoring models.

### Environment Separation
Maintain a clear separation between the testing environment (using stubs and synthetic models) and the production environment (where real models will be integrated). This ensures that development can proceed smoothly even if the actual scoring models are still under development.

## 3. Strategies for Seamless Integration in Production

### Configuration-Driven Model Selection
Design the system so that the selection of a scoring model is controlled via configuration (such as configuration files or a database). This enables you to easily switch from a stub to a real model by simply updating configuration settings.

### API Exposure
Develop an API endpoint that accepts the necessary input data in JSON format, processes the input using the configured scoring model, and returns the model's output. This API layer should abstract away the details of the underlying model integration.

### Containerization with Docker
Package the application in Docker containers. This ensures a consistent runtime environment from development to production, making it easier to deploy and scale the system.

### Logging and Monitoring
Implement logging to capture execution details, such as:
- Inputs received
- Outputs returned
- Errors encountered
- Performance metrics
- Execution times
- Error rates

This is crucial for maintaining system health and troubleshooting once the real models are integrated.
